Estimating Plate Tectonic Forces at the New Zealand Plate Boundary Using Strain Rates Derived from a Kinematic Model of Fault Slip

This repository contains code and data associated with Hirschberg & Sutherland (2023).

The code used for the model inversion is from Haines & Sutherland (2018) and the user is referred to their paper for inversion codes.
Codes relating to parameter adjustment are present in the 'code' folder.

Data input into the models and data output by the models are present in the 'data' folder.
Input data is in the 'input' folder. Kinematic data derives from Hirschberg & Sutherland (2022). Topography data derives from Mitchell et al. (2012).
Output data for each model is in the folder of that model's name.
